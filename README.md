- April 3, 1972, Telnet Protocol,
- At the October 1971 Network Working Group Meeting, I promised to
   promptly produce a document which clearly and succinctly specified
   and explained the Official Telnet Protocol.  This document fails to
   meet any part of that promise.  This document was not produced
   promptly.  This document is neither clear nor succinct.  There is NO
   Official Telnet Protocol.
675
- December 1974,  SPECIFICATION OF INTERNET TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROGRAM, 
- This document describes the functions to be performed by the
   internetwork Transmission Control Program [TCP] and its interface to
   programs or users that require its services. Several basic
   assumptions are made about process to process communication and these
   are listed here without further justification. The interested reader
   is referred to [CEKA74, TOML74, BELS74, DALA74, SUNS74] for further
   discussion.

- INTERNET PROTOCOL DARPA INTERNET PROGRAM PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION,  September 1981
- This document specifies the DoD Standard Internet Protocol.  This
document is based on six earlier editions of the ARPA Internet Protocol
Specification, and the present text draws heavily from them.  There have
been many contributors to this work both in terms of concepts and in
terms of text.  This edition revises aspects of addressing, error
handling, option codes, and the security, precedence, compartments, and
handling restriction features of the internet protocol.

- September 1981,  TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL DARPA INTERNET PROGRAM  PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION
- This document describes the DoD Standard Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP).  There have been nine earlier editions of the ARPA TCP
specification on which this standard is based, and the present text
draws heavily from them.  There have been many contributors to this work
both in terms of concepts and in terms of text.  This edition clarifies
several details and removes the end-of-letter buffer-size adjustments,
and redescribes the letter mechanism as a push function.

- August 1982,  The Domain Naming Convention for Internet User Applications, 
-  For many years, the naming convention "<user>@<host>" has served the
   ARPANET user community for its mail system, and the substring
   "<host>" has been used for other applications such as file transfer
   (FTP) and terminal access (Telnet).  With the advent of network
   interconnection, this naming convention needs to be generalized to
   accommodate internetworking.  A decision has recently been reached to
   replace the simple name field, "<host>", by a composite name field,
   "<domain>" [2].  This note is an attempt to clarify this generalized
   naming convention, the Internet Naming Convention, and to explore the
   implications of its adoption for Internet name service and user
   applications.

- November 1987, DOMAIN NAMES - CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES
- This RFC is an introduction to the Domain Name System (DNS), and omits
many details which can be found in a companion RFC, "Domain Names -
Implementation and Specification" [RFC-1035].  That RFC assumes that the
reader is familiar with the concepts discussed in this memo.
  
1855
- October 1995, Netiquette Guidelines, 
- This document provides a minimum set of guidelines for Network
   Etiquette (Netiquette) which organizations may take and adapt for
   their own use.  As such, it is deliberately written in a bulleted
   format to make adaptation easier and to make any particular item easy
   (or easier) to find.  It also functions as a minimum set of
   guidelines for individuals, both users and administrators.  This memo
   is the product of the Responsible Use of the Network (RUN) Working
   Group of the IETF.

- 1 April 1998, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)
- There is coffee all over the world. Increasingly, in a world in which
   computing is ubiquitous, the computists want to make coffee. Coffee
   brewing is an art, but the distributed intelligence of the web-
   connected world transcends art.  Thus, there is a strong, dark, rich
   requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of
   coffee. Coffee is brewed using coffee pots.  Networked coffee pots
   require a control protocol if they are to be controlled.
